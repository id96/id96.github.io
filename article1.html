							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<h2><span class="italic">The first steps...</span></h2>
							<p>As an Info Sci & French double major, I never thought my two seemingly polar disciplines would intersect. But then came Barron/DeDeo’s project, which showed me that YES French can be computed.
							Take the French Revolution and some python scripting and BOOM you have my senior honors thesis. Over the course of senior year, I’m going to measure word-use patterns spoken during Parliamentary 
							sessions of the French Revolution. And if that sounds cool, you’re right, because it is. This project is directly inspired by the work of Barron/DeDeo and their findings, <span class="italic">Individuals, Institutions, and Innovation in the Debates of the French Revolution</span>. 
							We wanted to evaluate the duplicability of this study by replicating it. This study seeks to measure how revolutionary ideas were presented in NCA Parliament and then how these ideas shaped the future of European governmental structures by using digital archives available to the public.</p>
							
							<p>Last spring, Isabelle studied abroad in Paris, where she studied Philosophy and Art History at <span class="italic">La Sorbonne</span>.
								During this semester out of Ithaca, it was the 50th anniversary of the Mai 1968 Paris Student Revolutions. Isabelle experienced <span class="italic">manifestations,</span>
								protests, and revolution herself at this time. This project on Revolution is fitting as Isabelle is interested in how Revolutions shape our lives. Isabelle 
								also took a course in Fall 2017 with Camille Robcis and Jason Frank, <span class="italic">Revolution</span>, which emphasized the nuances of the French Revolution and 
								was Isabelle's first introduction to the material used in this project (parliamentary archives of the National Assemblée).</p>
