							<h1>Introduction</h1>
							<h2><i>The first steps...</i></h2>
							<h4>September 25th, 2018</h4>
							<p> Blog Post is currently being edited. Final draft coming soon! </p>
							<!-- <p>As an Information Science & French double major (eclectic combination, I know), I never thought that my two seemingly polar disciplines would <i>ever</i> intersect. But then my Junior year fall semester rolled around and I took a class that proved to me that tech and the humanities could get along: Text Mining. 
							We theorized about the ethics and legitimacy of writing code to analyse historical and literary texts, and then we wrote that code anyways. By the end of the semester, I was hooked (more topic models, please!). But as bad timing would have it, I was heading off to Paris that spring to study abroad, so any work would have had to wait for senior year.</p>

							<p>When I was abroad in Paris, I experienced real revolution. It was the 50th anniversary of the famous/infamous Mai 1968 Student Revolutions and French university students had the same feelings 
								towards the government. Students would block the elevators and thus anyone from going to class, a Molotov cocktail was found at one of my campuses, and for the final exam of my Philosophé Générale class, 259
								students elected to have an "Assemblée Générale" instead and vote to see whether we would take the exam or not (if you're interested, we did not take the exam, there were 160 contre l'exam, 6 pour, and 14 who thought the question itself wasn't legit)								
								Isabelle experienced <i>manifestations,</i>
										protests, and revolution herself at this time. This project on Revolution is fitting as Isabelle is interested in how Revolutions shape our lives. Isabelle 
										also took a course in Fall 2017 with Camille Robcis and Jason Frank, <i>Revolution</i>, which emphasized the nuances of the French Revolution and 
										was Isabelle's first introduction to the material used in this project (parliamentary archives of the National Assemblée).</p>
								You might be wondering why this blog is called <i>Computational Revolution</i>. 
								 </p>

							<p>Which worked out totally fine because this past fall, Professor Mimno and Laure proposed the <i>coolest</i> project. A team at the University of Pennsylvania (Simon DeDeo et al) had completed an intensive text mining experiment on archived texts from the French Revolution, called <i>Individuals, Institutions, and Innovation in the Debates of the French Revolution</i>.  
							They found word-use patterns and overall trends that suggest that the French Revolution parliamentary body shaped the future of European governmental structures and how language was used. 
							This year, I'm going to replicate this study to evaluate its duplicability and I'm going find out how to optimize the technical process along the way.</p>

							<p>So there you have it. Take the French Revolution and a lot of python scripts and BOOM you have my Senior honors thesis. And I could not be more excited.</p>

							<p>More posts to come about my first steps! Until then, bien à vous. --Isabelle.</p>
